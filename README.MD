#  Renamer (Object Oriented)

## Description
Renamer is a simple app with a GUI for file name editing that can help
when working on large numbers of files where a lot of manual changes are
very time consuming. 

The project was developed in python using the CustomTkinter for learning
basics of python scripting and a popular GUI library for python and also for personal use.

## Dependencies
The app was created on python version 3.12.4 with the following libraries:

-tkinter

Other functionality has not been finalised, but will be analogous to the existing one and may be added in the future.

## Usage
